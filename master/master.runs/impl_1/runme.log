WARNING: [DRC DPOP-1] PREG Output pipelining: DSP screen/sDesigner/vStart0 output screen/sDesigner/vStart0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.

WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP screen/sDesigner/vStart0 multiplier stage screen/sDesigner/vStart0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net movement/atan/angle_reg[7]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin movement/atan/angle_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell movement/atan/angle_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC ZPS7-1] PS7 block required: The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
